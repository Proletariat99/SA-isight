# Dave Dyer (Science) and Bert Shuler (Splunk)
# This is our list of stuff to do for version 1.0 
# Current Version = 0.75
# Next Version = 1.0 

- fix the time_tracker file to not grow infinitely -- only needs to keep 3 values.
- add some logging (general debug logging using Splunk's builtin capabilities)
- put it in an infinite loop so that it's a singleton when it runs.
- make the singleton configurable within the modular input settings (more settings)
- configure modular input capabilities for other isight rest endpoints (reports, indexes, warnings, etc).


# version 2.0 stuff
- compartmentalize iocs into file v. web v. email
- viz
- stats

# version 3.0 stuff
- separate configuration page to turn on the scheduled search.
